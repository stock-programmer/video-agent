New API features in Gemini 3
Gemini 3 introduces new parameters designed to give developers more control over latency, cost, and multimodal fidelity.

Thinking level
Gemini 3 series models use dynamic thinking by default to reason through prompts. You can use the thinking_level parameter, which controls the maximum depth of the model's internal reasoning process before it produces a response. Gemini 3 treats these levels as relative allowances for thinking rather than strict token guarantees.

If thinking_level is not specified, Gemini 3 will default to high. For faster, lower-latency responses when complex reasoning isn't required, you can constrain the model's thinking level to low.

Gemini 3 Pro and Flash thinking levels:

The following thinking levels are supported by both Gemini 3 Pro and Flash:

low: Minimizes latency and cost. Best for simple instruction following, chat, or high-throughput applications
high (Default, dynamic): Maximizes reasoning depth. The model may take significantly longer to reach a first token, but the output will be more carefully reasoned.
Gemini 3 Flash thinking levels

In addition to the levels above, Gemini 3 Flash also supports the following thinking levels that are not currently supported by Gemini 3 Pro:

minimal: Matches the “no thinking” setting for most queries. The model may think very minimally for complex coding tasks. Minimizes latency for chat or high throughput applications.

Note: Circulation of thought signatures is required even when thinking level is set to minimal for Gemini 3 Flash.
medium: Balanced thinking for most tasks.

Python
JavaScript
REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-3-pro-preview",
    contents: "How does AI work?",
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        thinkingLevel: "low",
      }
    },
  });

console.log(response.text);
Important: You cannot use both thinking_level and the legacy thinking_budget parameter in the same request. Doing so will return a 400 error.
Media resolution
Gemini 3 introduces granular control over multimodal vision processing via the media_resolution parameter. Higher resolutions improve the model's ability to read fine text or identify small details, but increase token usage and latency. The media_resolution parameter determines the maximum number of tokens allocated per input image or video frame.

You can now set the resolution to media_resolution_low, media_resolution_medium, media_resolution_high, or media_resolution_ultra_high per individual media part or globally (via generation_config, global not available for ultra high). If unspecified, the model uses optimal defaults based on the media type.

Recommended settings

Media Type	Recommended Setting	Max Tokens	Usage Guidance
Images	media_resolution_high	1120	Recommended for most image analysis tasks to ensure maximum quality.
PDFs	media_resolution_medium	560	Optimal for document understanding; quality typically saturates at medium. Increasing to high rarely improves OCR results for standard documents.
Video (General)	media_resolution_low (or media_resolution_medium)	70 (per frame)	Note: For video, low and medium settings are treated identically (70 tokens) to optimize context usage. This is sufficient for most action recognition and description tasks.
Video (Text-heavy)	media_resolution_high	280 (per frame)	Required only when the use case involves reading dense text (OCR) or small details within video frames.
Note: The media_resolution parameter maps to different token counts depending on the input type. While images scale linearly (media_resolution_low: 280, media_resolution_medium: 560, media_resolution_high: 1120), Video is compressed more aggressively. For Video, both media_resolution_low and media_resolution_medium are capped at 70 tokens per frame, and media_resolution_high is capped at 280 tokens. See full details here
Python
JavaScript
REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

// The media_resolution parameter is currently only available in the v1alpha API version.
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiVersion: "v1alpha" });

async function run() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-3-pro-preview",
    contents: [
      {
        parts: [
          { text: "What is in this image?" },
          {
            inlineData: {
              mimeType: "image/jpeg",
              data: "...",
            },
            mediaResolution: {
              level: "media_resolution_high"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  });

  console.log(response.text);
}

run();
Temperature
For Gemini 3, we strongly recommend keeping the temperature parameter at its default value of 1.0.

While previous models often benefited from tuning temperature to control creativity versus determinism, Gemini 3's reasoning capabilities are optimized for the default setting. Changing the temperature (setting it below 1.0) may lead to unexpected behavior, such as looping or degraded performance, particularly in complex mathematical or reasoning tasks.

Thought signatures
Gemini 3 uses Thought signatures to maintain reasoning context across API calls. These signatures are encrypted representations of the model's internal thought process. To ensure the model maintains its reasoning capabilities you must return these signatures back to the model in your request exactly as they were received:

Function Calling (Strict): The API enforces strict validation on the "Current Turn". Missing signatures will result in a 400 error.

Note: Circulation of thought signatures is required even when thinking level is set to minimal for Gemini 3 Flash.
Text/Chat: Validation is not strictly enforced, but omitting signatures will degrade the model's reasoning and answer quality.

Image generation/editing (Strict): The API enforces strict validation on all Model parts including a thoughtSignature. Missing signatures will result in a 400 error.

Success: If you use the official SDKs (Python, Node, Java) and standard chat history, Thought Signatures are handled automatically. You do not need to manually manage these fields.
Function calling (strict validation)
When Gemini generates a functionCall, it relies on the thoughtSignature to process the tool's output correctly in the next turn. The "Current Turn" includes all Model (functionCall) and User (functionResponse) steps that occurred since the last standard User text message.

Single Function Call: The functionCall part contains a signature. You must return it.
Parallel Function Calls: Only the first functionCall part in the list will contain the signature. You must return the parts in the exact order received.
Multi-Step (Sequential): If the model calls a tool, receives a result, and calls another tool (within the same turn), both function calls have signatures. You must return all accumulated signatures in the history.
Text and streaming
For standard chat or text generation, the presence of a signature is not guaranteed.

Non-Streaming: The final content part of the response may contain a thoughtSignature, though it is not always present. If one is returned, you should send it back to maintain best performance.
Streaming: If a signature is generated, it may arrive in a final chunk that contains an empty text part. Ensure your stream parser checks for signatures even if the text field is empty.
Image generation and editing
For gemini-3-pro-image-preview, thought signatures are critical for conversational editing. When you ask the model to modify an image it relies on the thoughtSignature from the previous turn to understand the composition and logic of the original image.

Editing: Signatures are guaranteed on the first part after the thoughts of the response (text or inlineData) and on every subsequent inlineData part. You must return all of these signatures to avoid errors.

Migrating from other models
If you are transferring a conversation trace from another model (e.g., Gemini 2.5) or injecting a custom function call that was not generated by Gemini 3, you will not have a valid signature.

To bypass strict validation in these specific scenarios, populate the field with this specific dummy string: "thoughtSignature": "context_engineering_is_the_way_to_go"

Structured Outputs with tools
Gemini 3 models allow you to combine Structured Outputs with built-in tools, including Grounding with Google Search, URL Context, and Code Execution.

Python
JavaScript
REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodToJsonSchema } from "zod-to-json-schema";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

const matchSchema = z.object({
  winner: z.string().describe("The name of the winner."),
  final_match_score: z.string().describe("The final score."),
  scorers: z.array(z.string()).describe("The name of the scorer.")
});

async function run() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-3-pro-preview",
    contents: "Search for all details for the latest Euro.",
    config: {
      tools: [
        { googleSearch: {} },
        { urlContext: {} }
      ],
      responseMimeType: "application/json",
      responseJsonSchema: zodToJsonSchema(matchSchema),
    },
  });

  const match = matchSchema.parse(JSON.parse(response.text));
  console.log(match);
}

run();
Image generation
Gemini 3 Pro Image lets you generate and edit images from text prompts. It uses reasoning to "think" through a prompt and can retrieve real-time data—such as weather forecasts or stock charts—before using Google Search grounding before generating high-fidelity images.

New & improved capabilities:

4K & text rendering: Generate sharp, legible text and diagrams with up to 2K and 4K resolutions.
Grounded generation: Use the google_search tool to verify facts and generate imagery based on real-world information.
Conversational editing: Multi-turn image editing by simply asking for changes (e.g., "Make the background a sunset"). This workflow relies on Thought Signatures to preserve visual context between turns.
For complete details on aspect ratios, editing workflows, and configuration options, see the Image Generation guide.

Migrating from Gemini 2.5
Gemini 3 is our most capable model family to date and offers a stepwise improvement over Gemini 2.5. When migrating, consider the following:

Thinking: If you were previously using complex prompt engineering (like chain of thought) to force Gemini 2.5 to reason, try Gemini 3 with thinking_level: "high" and simplified prompts.
Temperature settings: If your existing code explicitly sets temperature (especially to low values for deterministic outputs), we recommend removing this parameter and using the Gemini 3 default of 1.0 to avoid potential looping issues or performance degradation on complex tasks.
PDF & document understanding: Default OCR resolution for PDFs has changed. If you relied on specific behavior for dense document parsing, test the new media_resolution_high setting to ensure continued accuracy.
Token consumption: Migrating to Gemini 3 defaults may increase token usage for PDFs but decrease token usage for video. If requests now exceed the context window due to higher default resolutions, we recommend explicitly reducing the media resolution.
Image segmentation: Image segmentation capabilities (returning pixel-level masks for objects) are not supported in Gemini 3 Pro or Gemini 3 Flash. For workloads requiring native image segmentation, we recommend continuing to utilize Gemini 2.5 Flash with thinking turned off or Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5.
Tool support: Maps grounding and Computer use tools are not yet supported for Gemini 3 models, so won't migrate. Additionally, combining built-in tools with function calling is not yet supported.
OpenAI compatibility
For users utilizing the OpenAI compatibility layer, standard parameters are automatically mapped to Gemini equivalents:

reasoning_effort (OAI) maps to thinking_level (Gemini). Note that reasoning_effort medium maps to thinking_level high.
Prompting best practices
Gemini 3 is a reasoning model, which changes how you should prompt.

Precise instructions: Be concise in your input prompts. Gemini 3 responds best to direct, clear instructions. It may over-analyze verbose or overly complex prompt engineering techniques used for older models.
Output verbosity: By default, Gemini 3 is less verbose and prefers providing direct, efficient answers. If your use case requires a more conversational or "chatty" persona, you must explicitly steer the model in the prompt (e.g., "Explain this as a friendly, talkative assistant").
Context management: When working with large datasets (e.g., entire books, codebases, or long videos), place your specific instructions or questions at the end of the prompt, after the data context. Anchor the model's reasoning to the provided data by starting your question with a phrase like, "Based on the information above...".
Learn more about prompt design strategies in the prompt engineering guide.
