## New Features Overview

### 1. Video Duration Control

**What it does**: Choose the length of your generated video.

**Available options**:
- **5 seconds**: Quick action shots, short clips
- **10 seconds**: Standard scenes, most common use case
- **15 seconds**: Extended sequences, longer narratives

**Default**: 5 seconds

**When to use**:
- Use **5 seconds** for quick social media clips or action shots
- Use **10 seconds** for most standard video content
- Use **15 seconds** when you need more time to tell your story

**Tip**: Longer videos take more time to generate. Start with 5 seconds to test your settings, then increase to 10 or 15 for your final video.

### 2. Aspect Ratio Selection

**What it does**: Choose the shape and format of your video to match different platforms.

**Available options**:
- **16:9 (Landscape)**: Wide format, horizontal video
- **9:16 (Portrait)**: Tall format, vertical video
- **1:1 (Square)**: Equal width and height

**Tip**: Choose your aspect ratio based on where you plan to share your video. Using the right format ensures your video looks great without black bars.

### 3. Motion Intensity Control

**What it does**: Adjusts how dynamic and energetic the movement in your video is.

**Available options**: 1 (Calm) to 5 (Dynamic)
- **1-2 (Calm)**: Subtle, slow movements - peaceful scenes
- **3 (Medium)**: Natural, balanced motion - most versatile
- **4-5 (Dynamic)**: Fast, energetic action - exciting scenes

**Default**: 3 (Medium)

**When to use**:
- **Level 1-2**: Landscapes, peaceful scenes, slow pans, gentle movements
- **Level 3**: General purpose, works well for most content
- **Level 4-5**: Action scenes, sports, dancing, fast-paced content

**Tip**: Match the motion intensity to your content. A sunset scene works better with low intensity (1-2), while a running scene needs high intensity (4-5).

### 4. Quality Preset

**What it does**: Lets you choose between faster generation (lower quality) or better quality (slower generation).

**Available options**:
- **Draft** (720p, ~1 minute): Fast previews for testing
- **Standard** (1080p, ~2 minutes): Recommended for most uses
- **High** (1080p+, ~4 minutes): Best quality for final outputs

**Default**: Standard

**When to use**:
- **Draft**: When testing different settings or motion prompts
- **Standard**: For most final videos, good balance of quality and speed
- **High**: For important videos where quality is critical

**Tip**: Use Draft mode to experiment with different parameters quickly. Once you're happy with the settings, switch to Standard or High for your final video.
